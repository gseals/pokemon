# React Pokemon

## Description

* This application utilizes the [openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and allows users to search for current weather based on city name. For good measure, since the API doesn't specify the state the city is in, latitude and longitude are also listed to provide more specificity. The background changes based on the temperature: at or below 60째F renders a cooler colored background; at or above 61째F renders a warmer colored background.
